            <h2>Welcome to JoBase</h2>
            
            <p>
                JoBase is a really fast Python game library for beginner coders.
                It is written in pure C and uses the same modern tools as high-end games like Minecraft.
            </p>

            <p>
                We now support an online JoBase editor!
                Feel free to use it before installing JoBase on your local computer.
                Click <a href = Browser target = _blank>here</a> to try it now.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, JoBase has execution issues on <mark>MacOS</mark>.
                Please use the online version instead.
            </p>

            <h3>Download Python</h3>

            To start using <mark>JoBase</mark>, you will need <mark>Python</mark> installed.
            Visit <a href = //www.python.org/downloads target = _blank>python.org</a>
            and download the latest version for your computer.

            <h3>Install JoBase</h3>

            To install <mark>JoBase</mark>, type the following into the
            <mark>Command Terminal</mark>.

            <pre code>‡pip install JoBase‡</pre>

            If the installation fails, please contact us at
            <a href = mailto:problem@jobase.org>problem@jobase.org</a>
            with a full copy of the error and the name of your operating system.
            If the installation succeeded, you can continue by typing the
            following command to run a basic exmaple.

            <pre code>‡python -m JoBase.examples.coin_collector‡</pre>

            If everything works, you are ready to start coding!
            The minimal Python example below demonstrates the structure of a basic JoBase application.

            <pre editor>
                from JoBase import *

                window.caption = "JoBase Example"
                man = Image(MAN)

                def loop():
                    man.draw()

                run()
            </pre>

            As you can see, the program above sets the window caption.
            We then load an image and draw it in the game loop.
            Please follow our <a href = examples>examples</a> for an introduction to the features of JoBase.

            <h2>Performance</h2>

            <img src = assets/images/graph.png>

            <p>
                Above is a JoBase speed comparison with other popular Python libraries.
                The graph compares the performance of the libraries <mark>without batch rendering</mark>.
                Hundreds of images were drawn on the screen in random places and rotated in the game loop.
            </p>

            <pre editor>
                from JoBase import *
                images = []

                for i in range(100):
                    images.append(Image(MAN, angle = random(1, 360)))

                def loop():
                    if window.resize:
                        for man in images:
                            man.pos = random(window.left, window.right), random(window.top, window.bottom)

                    for man in images:
                        man.angle += 1
                        man.draw()

                run()

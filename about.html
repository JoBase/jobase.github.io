			<h2>About JoBase</h2>
			JoBase is a Python library that has been designed for making games.
			It has been built to make coding fun and intuitive.
			JoBase is built in {Pyglet} which is a fast and stable library written in pure Python.

			At the moment, JoBase doesn't have any tutorials or examples.
			These features are coming soon.

			<!--<h3>Teaching</h3>
			Teachers will find JoBase useful, the tutorials are structured for independent learning.
			When students want to make a game, instead of writing loads of set up code, they can get started straight away.

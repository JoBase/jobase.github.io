            <h2>First Steps</h2>

            <p>
                To get started with JoBase you need <mark>Python</mark> installed.
                Please follow the steps on the <a href = "/">homepage</a> if you haven't installed <mark>Python</mark> already.
            </p>

            <p>
                Open the <mark>Python IDLE</mark> (or your favourite editor) and create a new file.
                Start by typing the following code.
            </p>

            <pre>‡from JoBase import *‡</pre>

            <p>
                This imports and initialises all the tools from the <mark>JoBase</mark> library.
                When you run the code, it should print <mark>Welcome to JoBase</mark> in the <mark>Python Shell</mark>.
                Now we need to display the window for our game.
            </p>

            <pre>
                from JoBase import *

                ‡run()‡
            </pre>

            <p>
                The <mark>run()</mark> method displays the window and activates a game loop.
                When you run the code, you should have a blank, resisable window.
                These two lines of code are necessary for every <mark>JoBase</mark> application. 
            </p>

            <p>
                All games run inside a loop; this loop runs continuously for every frame.
                The code below shows how you can create this loop.
            </p>

            <pre>
                from JoBase import *

                ‡print("start")

                def loop():
                    print("loop")‡

                run()
            </pre>

            <p>
                You may notice that we print <mark>"start"</mark> outside the loop and we print <mark>"loop"</mark> inside the loop.
                When you run the code, the <mark>Python Shell</mark> will keep printing until you close the program.
                Now we can start drawing things on the screen.
            </p>

            <pre>
                from JoBase import *

                ‡text = Text("Hello World")‡

                def loop():
                    ‡text.draw()‡

                run()
            </pre>

            <p>
                This will render a <mark>Hello World</mark> message on the screen.
                Remember to always draw things in the game loop so that they are displayed every frame.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now you understand the basics of a JoBase application, you can create your first game.
                If you are familiar with <mark>Python</mark>, please use the <a href = /reference>reference</a> to get an understanding of the features of JoBase.

            <h2>Welcome to JoBase</h2>
            
            <p>
                JoBase is a really fast Python game library for beginner coders.
                It is written in pure C and uses the same modern tools as high-end games like Minecraft.
            </p>

            <p>
                We now support an online JoBase editor!
                Feel free to use it before installing JoBase on your local computer.
                Click <a href = Browser target = _blank>here</a> to try it now.
            </p>

            <h3>Download Python</h3>

            <p>
                To start using JoBase on your local computer, you will need <mark>Python</mark> installed.
                Visit <a href = //python.org/downloads target = _blank>python.org</a> and download the latest version for your computer.
            </p>

            <h3>Install JoBase</h3>

            <p>
                To install <mark>JoBase</mark>, type the following into the <mark>Command Terminal</mark>.
            </p>

            <pre>pip install JoBase</pre>

            <p>
                If the installation fails, check your version of Python isn't too old.
                JoBase is compatible on Python 3.6 or greater.
                If the installation succeeds, you can continue by typing the following command to run a basic exmaple.
            </p>

            <pre>python -m JoBase.examples.physics</pre>

            <p>
                If everything works, you are ready to start coding!
                The minimal Python example below demonstrates the structure of a basic JoBase application.
            </p>

            <pre editor>
from JoBase import *

window.color = LIGHT_BLUE
man = Image(MAN, color = GOLD)

def loop():
    man.angle += 1
    man.draw()

run()
            </pre>

            <p>
                In the example above, we load an image and draw it in the game loop, increasing its angle by one each frame.
                Please follow our <a href = examples>examples</a> for an introduction to the features of JoBase.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance</h2>

            <img src = assets/images/graph.png>

            <p>
                Above is a speed comparison with other popular Python libraries.
                The graph compares the performance of the libraries without batch rendering.
                Hundreds of images were drawn on the screen in random places and rotated in the game loop.
            </p>

            <pre editor>
from JoBase import *
images = []

for i in range(100):
    man = Image(MAN, angle = random(1, 360))
    man.x = random(camera.left, camera.right)
    man.y = random(camera.top, camera.bottom)

    images.append(man)

def loop():
    for man in images:
        man.angle += 1
        man.draw()

run()
            </pre>

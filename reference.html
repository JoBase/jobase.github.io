            <p>
                Welcome to the JoBase reference manual.
                Please look at the examples below before you carry on.
            </p>

            <p>
                All colours are lists of three or four values.
                The values are <mark>red</mark>, <mark>green</mark>, <mark>blue</mark> and <mark>alpha</mark>.
                With these values, you can create any colour.
                The values are decimals and they range between <mark>0</mark> and <mark>1</mark>.
                Whenever you set the colour of an object, you can pass a <mark>list</mark>, <mark>tuple</mark> or <mark>dictionary</mark>.

                <pre>
                    color = [1, 0, 0] # red
                    color = (0.5, 0, 1) # purple
                    color = {"red": 1, "green": 1, "blue": 0} # yellow
                    color = (0, 1, 0, 0.5) # translucent green
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                All positions or sizes are made of two values - an <mark>x</mark> and a <mark>y</mark>.
                These values are units in pixels from the centre of the window.
                Just like colours, you can pass a <mark>list</mark>, <mark>tuple</mark> or <mark>dictionary</mark> when you set the position or size of an object.
            </p>

            <pre class = large id = Window>
                class Window(caption = "JoBase", width = 640, height = 480, color = (1, 1, 1))
            </pre>

            <div class = indent>
                This class is for managing the main window.
                The inbuilt <mark>window</mark> variable is an instance of this class.
                Do not try to instance this class directly.

                <div class = indent>
                    Close the window.
                    The program finishes and the window cannot be opened again.

                <pre class = small id = Window.maximize>maximize()</pre>

                <div class = indent>
                    Maximize the window.
                    You can restore the maximized window with the <a href = #Window.restore>restore</a> method.

                    Give the window input focus.
                    It can be very disruptive to the user when the window is forced to the top - use this method sensibly.
                </div>
            </div>

            <pre class = large id = Camera>

            <div class = indent>
                This class is for detecting keyboard input.

                <pre class = small id = Key.press>press: bool</pre>

                <div class = indent>
                    A key is pressed down.

                <pre class = small id = Key.repeat>repeat: bool</pre>

                <div class = indent>
                    When the user holds a key down, a series of events are fired.
                    These events do not occur every frame.

                    </pre>

                    If a key is not being held down, it's properties cannot be accessed.
                    Make sure you check that the key state is not <mark>False</mark> before trying to access a property.
                    Below is a list of all the key names.

                This class is for drawing images.
                Because it extends the <a href = #Rectangle>Rectangle</a> class, it contains all the same attributes.
                The <mark>name</mark> is a string of the filepath to the image.
                JoBase contains the following built in images.

                The example below loads the coin image and draws it.

                Activate the main game loop and display the window.
                Always call this method at the bottom of your code.

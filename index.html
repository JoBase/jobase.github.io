			<h2>Welcome to JoBase</h2>
			JoBase is aimed at beginner coders who want to have fun making games with Python.
			<p></p>
			Follow steps below to prepare your computer for JoBase.
			<!--After that, you can get coding straight away without any previous coding knowledge.
			Our set of tutorials will help you start even if you don't know anything about code.-->

			<h3>Download Python</h3>
			The instructions below will show you how to set up Python on Windows.
			<p></p>
			Find the {Python Downloads} page or click the link <a href = "https://python.org/downloads">here</a>.
			On the screen you will see a yellow download button.
			Click on it and save the file.
			<p></p>
			When you have downloaded the file, run it.
			A new window should appear.
			BEFORE you press the {Install Now} button, tick the box that says {Add Python to PATH}.
			Your screen should look like <a class = "chocolat-image" href = "resources/python_1.png" title = "Python Installer">this</a>.
			Once you have done that, click {Install Now} and then {YES}.
			Python will start installing. This may take a while.
			Once Python has been successfully installed, you can take a break.

			<h3>Install JoBase</h3>
			Now it's time to install JoBase.
			<p></p>
			Open the {Command Terminal} on your computer.
			It's a black screen with white text.
			You can find it by typing {cmd} into your computer's search bar.
			Once you've opened it, type the following command into the terminal.

			<div class = "code">
				<pre>pip install JoBase</pre>
			</div>

			Press {ENTER} and wait for JoBase to install.
			The command terminal should look similar to <a class = "chocolat-image" href = "resources/command_1.png" title = "Install JoBase">this</a>.
			Because all operating systems are different, your command terminal may vary from the image.
			<p></p>
			If there aren't any errors (shown in red) then JoBase has been sucessfully installed.
			<p></p>
			If you have problems when installing JoBase, you may need to run the command terminal as administrator.
			To do this, open the command terminal by right clicking and selecting {Run as administrator} instead of just clicking on it.
			<p></p>
			If you are still struggling to set up JoBase, then ask a friend to help.
			<p></p>
			You have completed all the installation steps.

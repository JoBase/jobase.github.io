            <p>
                Welcome to the JoBase reference manual.
                Please look at the examples below before you carry on.
            </p>

            <p>
                All colours are lists of three or four values.
                The values are <mark>red</mark>, <mark>green</mark>, <mark>blue</mark> and <mark>alpha</mark>.
                With these values, you can create any colour.
                The values are decimals and they range between <mark>0</mark> and <mark>1</mark>.
                Whenever you set the colour of an object, you can pass a <mark>list</mark>, <mark>tuple</mark> or <mark>dictionary</mark>.

                <pre>
                    color = [1, 0, 0] # red
                    color = (0.5, 0, 1) # purple
                    color = {"red": 1, "green": 1, "blue": 0} # yellow
                    color = (0, 1, 0, 0.5) # translucent green
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                All positions or sizes are made of two values - an <mark>x</mark> and a <mark>y</mark>.
                These values are units in pixels from the centre of the window.
                Just like colours, you can pass a <mark>list</mark>, <mark>tuple</mark> or <mark>dictionary</mark> when you set the position or size of an object.
            </p>

            <pre class = large id = Window>
                class Window(caption = "JoBase", width = 640, height = 480, color = (1, 1, 1))
            </pre>

            <div class = indent>
                This class is for managing the main window.
                The inbuilt <mark>window</mark> variable is an instance of this class.

                <div class = indent>
                    Close the window.
                    The program finishes and the window cannot be opened again.

                <pre class = small id = Window.maximize>maximize()</pre>

                <div class = indent>
                    Maximize the window.
                    You can restore the maximized window with the <a href = #Window.restore>restore</a> method.

                    Give the window input focus.
                    It can be very disruptive to the user when the window is forced to the top - use this method sensibly.
                </div>
            </div>

            <pre class = large id = Camera>

            <div class = indent>
                This class is for detecting keyboard input.

                <pre class = small id = Key.press>press: bool</pre>

                <div class = indent>
                    A key is pressed down.

                <pre class = small id = Key.repeat>repeat: bool</pre>

                <div class = indent>
                    When the user holds a key down, a series of events are fired.
                    These events do not occur every frame.

                            # the right arrow key was pressed down
                    </pre>

                    If a key is not being held down, it's properties cannot be accessed.
                    Make sure you check that the key state is not <mark>False</mark> before trying to access a property.
                    Below is a list of all the key names.

                This class is for drawing images.
                Because it extends the <a href = #Rectangle>Rectangle</a> class, it contains all the same attributes.
                The <mark>name</mark> is a string of the filepath to the image.
                JoBase contains the following built in images.

                The example below loads the coin image and draws it.

                Find a random decimal between <mark>a</mark> and <mark>b</mark>.

            <div class = indent>
                Activate the main game loop and display the window.
                Always call this method at the bottom of your code.

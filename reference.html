                Welcome to the JoBase reference manual.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whenever you come across a position, color or size like the one below, it may seem like a <mark>tuple</mark> object.
                Although we have displayed it as a <mark>tuple</mark>, it behaves quite differently.
            </p>

            <code class = small>size: (float, float)</code>

            <p>
                The variable above is actually a JoBase vector.
                This means that its properties are keys.
                The example below illustrates how this variable can be used.
            </p>

            <pre code>
box = Rectangle(width = 20, height = 20)
print(box.size) # (20, 20)

box.size = 30, 10
print(box.size) # (30, 10)

box.size.x = 40
print(box.size) # (40, 10)
box.size = 100
print(box.size) # (100, 100)
            </pre>

            JoBase vectors also support rich comparisons and numerical operations.

            <pre code>
box.size = (5, 7)
box.pos = [5, 7]
print(box.size == box.pos) # True

box.pos += 1
print(box.pos) # (6, 8)
box.pos *= 2
print(box.pos) # (12, 16)
            </pre>

            <div class = indent>
                This class is for managing the main window.
                The inbuilt <mark>window</mark> variable is an instance of this class.
                Do not try to instance this class directly.

                <div class = indent>
                    Maximize the window.

                    Give the window input focus.
                    It can be very disruptive to the user when the window is forced to the top - use this method sensibly.
